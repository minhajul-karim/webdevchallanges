/* 

Hint 1:
Do use child selectors with '>' syntax

Hint 2:
You can select first child of 'someClass' with '.someClass > *:first-child'
The last one would be the same but ':last-child'

Hint 3: 
You can add classes to your HTML elements using JS, by adding it to the list of classes:
classList.add('.someClass')

To remove:
classList.remove('.someClass')

Hint 4:
Classes could be toggled.

Hint 5: 
For a funky growing effect, you can combine flex with cubic-bezier in a transform rule
