Part 1 (Calculation):
+Your first goal is to solve a simple text-based
math problem entered in the input field
+The problem can be add/sub/multiply/divide
+Here are few examples:
"3 + 3" -> 6
"10 - 3" -> 7
"44 / 2" -> 22
"2 \* 8" -> 16
+When the 'Solve' button is clicked
-Create a new div with the
class 'equation-component'
its text value should be the solution
to the input equation
-This element should be added as a child of
the `solutionDisplay` div

    Note: You can assume there will always only be 2 values,
        both whole integers, and always a space between each
        integer and the operator as in the above examples

Part 2 (Flex Display):
Then, you'll Flex your Flexbox skills! + Vertically stack the contents of the mainContainer + Center the content horizontally + Display all components of the equation
in the solutionDisplay using a horizontal Flexbox
with `space around` each component

Skills:
Event Listeners, String Manipulation, Array Manipulation,
Arithmetic, DOM Manipulation, Flexbox

STRETCH GOALS:
✔ Accept and solve more complex problems with more than 2 inputs
✔ Signal the different types of components (operator/value/solution) with different colors
✔ Accept strings without spaces + Can you improve the overall design?
